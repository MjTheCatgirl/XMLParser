To use this program: https://s3.amazonaws.com/abodo-misc/sample_abodo_feed.xml must be open in a web browser. Then, in 
command line, navigate to this program's directory. Once there, it can be run with the command 'rails s' and will display
results in a web browser at http://localhost:3000/. It also outputs to the command line if not redirected. I have included a text file in this zip that contains the results I got when running this using output redireaction to that file.
